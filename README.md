# XTRI — Cross-Tenant Risk Index
*Evidence-based exposure scoring for AI workloads running in shared cloud.*

XTRI computes an exposure score for AI/LLM applications on multi-tenant cloud by mapping your deployment to the **AI-in-Cloud Breach Playbook**. It’s vendor-neutral, case-driven, and automation-friendly.

> **Why XTRI?** Recent incidents show how AI-specific risks (prompts, agents, model I/O) combine with classic cloud gaps (isolation, secrets, supply chain) to cause **cross-tenant** exposure. XTRI turns those lessons into a practical, local tool.
